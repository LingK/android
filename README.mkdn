Getting Started
---------------

The mecha (Thunderbolt) requires a separate source tree in order to have a properly functioning RIL on all devices.

To initialize your local repository using the Team Liquid gingerbread [mecha] tree, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git@github.com:TeamLiquid/android.git -b gingerbread-mecha

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
